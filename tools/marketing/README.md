# Marketing-site build tooling

Working artifacts for the aglyn.com rebuild (Linear project **Marketing site
on Aglyn**). These are authoring inputs for the besigner, not application code
— nothing here is imported by any app.

| File | What it is |
| -- | -- |
| `product-page-skeleton.md` | The `/product/*` page contract: 8 sections, 74 text slots, in document order, plus the invariants (Container geometry, the heading-variant trap, the measured type scale). Derived by reading the built `/product/besigner` document live. |
| `apply-page-copy.js` | Pours one `product-copy/copy-<page>.json` into a freshly-pasted copy of that skeleton, in the besigner's page context. Verifies every section's slot count and writes **nothing** on a mismatch. |
| `product-copy/copy-<page>.json` | Copy and structure extracted verbatim from the Figma frames, one file per product page, plus a `claimsToVerify` list per page. |

## Why the applier refuses rather than repairs

A positional shift is the failure mode that matters when pouring copy into a
fixed skeleton: every heading is still a heading, every card body still a card
body — just one slot out. A screenshot of that looks entirely correct. So the
applier asserts the slot count of every section up front and returns the
mismatch instead of writing a partial page.

`null` in a flattened slot means **keep what the skeleton already has**, for
values that are invariant across the product pages (the Early-access chip
reads "Now in early access" on every one). Blanking a node because the copy
JSON happened not to name it would be the worst reading of a missing value.

Run it with `{dryRun: true}` first — it returns the before/after pairs.

## `claimsToVerify` is not decoration

The build rules forbid claiming capabilities Aglyn does not have. Each copy
file carries the phrases its extractor flagged. **These are unresolved.** The
sharpest one: the Plugins page states *"Every version is reviewed before it
ships"*, which contradicts the marketplace's deliberate design that a
publisher can install their own unreviewed version. Resolve the list before
any of this copy ships.

`copy-analytics.json` has **10 sections, not 8** — the Analytics page genuinely
differs from the skeleton and needs its own pass rather than being forced
through the applier.
