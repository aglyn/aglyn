On Pro and above, the organization's name and the console route and host travel with an Assist question. For an edit the assistant proposes in the besigner, an outline of the open page, component or layout: element and component ids, layer names, shortened setting values and the selected element's styles. For a generation job, the site inventory: the names and addresses of its screens and collections, the names of its components, layouts, templates, forms and datasets with their prop and field names, and the theme's summary, colors and fonts. For a theme change, the site's current theme settings and brand colors as hex values, from the organization's brand settings, the site logo in the media library or a public page the brief links to. For features that review or write search information, the text and structure of the pages concerned. For product copy, the store's name, the product's name, type, description, tags, options and search listing, the store's category names, and the product's first media-library photo as a copy at most 768 px on its longer edge with its metadata stripped; never another media file, a price, stock, an order or a customer. For products, categories and discounts proposed from a brief, the store's name and its existing category names. For an automation drafted from a brief, which of CRM, webhooks and bookings the plan includes; for an explanation, the automation's outline (trigger, conditions, each step's text with the names of the lists, campaigns, workflows, webhooks and datasets it uses and whether each exists, and a workflow's function names and expressions) and, for a failed run, its time, steps and recorded errors, with email addresses removed and never the triggering event's data. For an insight, the figure reports available and aggregate tables: traffic with top page paths, referrers and campaign tags; form views and submissions; revenue, orders and best-selling product names; bookings by service; campaign subjects with delivery, open and click rates; A/B test and variant conversions; and, for a dataset the member can see, field names and types, record and fill counts, number ranges and totals grouped by a value at least three records share. Email addresses and phone numbers are removed, and no individual record is sent. For CRM assistance, the opened contact, company, deal or lead as the CRM shows it: its name and, by kind, job title, company, lifecycle stage, tags, capture history and counts, domain, industry, headcount, pipeline stages, status, amount, dates, lost reason, parties and lead status, with its notes, newest timeline entries and open tasks and deals. Email addresses and phone numbers in that text are replaced, and no email, phone or postal field, marketing consent, custom field value, team member or record id is sent. An email draft adds the request and the record's merge field names; an import sends the field names and types and each column's header and value kind, never a row. No account identifiers, email addresses or authentication tokens.",
